# loremflickr-node

A website that provides placeholder images for every case, web or print, on almost any subject, in any size. This is basically a clone of [LoremFlickr.com](http://loremflickr.com) except it runs on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and uses the [rnd-flickr](https://github.com/kodie/rnd-flickr) module.

## Installation
1. Clone repository
1. `npm i`
1. `cp settings-example.json settings.json`
1. Edit `settings.json` to your liking (You'll also need to set your Flickr api key in there)
1. `npm start`

## To-Do
1. Look into scalability.
1. Add license, author, and image name to images.
1. Add various filter options (grayscale, pixelated, red, blue, green).
1. Possibly add daily image RSS feed.

## License
